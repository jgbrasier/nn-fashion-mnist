# Neural Network Classifier for Fashion MNIST database

Neural network and PCA methods to classify images in the fashion-MNIST database.
We use classical fully connected neural networks to classify images
We also explore how model complexity impacts accuracy
Finally through PCA dimensionaly reduction we see how logistic classification can be useful to improve results without complexifying models

Conclusion: simpler 1 layer models are somtimes better than bigger neural networks with dropout.
